--------------------------

I finally fixed a problem with the anonymous header code. The searches
are now all case insensitive. This fixes a problem where the spelling
of the HTTP headers could be different. It also helps with various
spellings of domain names. There is also a security fix for a format
string problem with the syslog feature. This problem doesn't affect
you if you use the log file instead.

-------------------------

Maybe I just shouldn't be working on the code base this week. The
memory fix I added in the last release contained a serious bug which
would cause a segmentation fault. I actually fixed this by removing
the code I added and just fixing the problem in ternary_insert()
instead. I don't know why I didn't do this in the first place. I also
removed the xstrstr() function since strstr() will do what tinyproxy
needs. Removing code is _always_ a good idea. Less code, less chance
of bugs.

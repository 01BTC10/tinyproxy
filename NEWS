This version (1.4.3pre7) should be the last release before I make a
full 1.4.3 release of tinyproxy. So, assuming no one reports any
problems with 1.4.3pre7 it will become 1.4.3 with no changes.

For more information as what has been worked on, look at the
ChangeLog. As you can tell, I don't keep this "NEWS" file very up to
date. All the real logging of information happens in the ChangeLog
file since I update it as I work on the code. Here on the other hand,
I have to remember what I've done. Not near as seamless. (Maybe I
should get somebody else to write the NEWS file...)

I finally fixed a problem with the anonymous header code. The searches
are now all case insensitive. This fixes a problem where the spelling
of the HTTP headers could be different. It also helps with various
spellings of domain names. There is also a security fix for a format
string problem with the syslog feature. This problem doesn't affect
you if you use the log file instead.

Well so much for the 1.4.0 version being the best tinyproxy---there
were bugs. The most serious was a segmentation fault problem when an
invalid request was received. Also, anonymous filtering was not
actually working. Another bug fix is that on Debian systems (and maybe
others) child threads would not be closed if they had been created
after tinyproxy had been started. Finally, if MaxClientRequests was
set to 0, the status of the thread was not going back to T_WAITING.

Okay, now on to the new features. There is a new Connect log
level. This is basically "Info" without info's noise. Also, the error
reporting function sends back more HTTP headers, which should lead to
a more standards compliant proxy.

There are a couple of features which I'm working on for the next
release. There has been requests for logging on tunnelled
connections. Also, some people would like HTTP filtering on tunnelled
connections. Finally, I do have the information to include SSL
connections, so I will be including it in the next release.

So, the above bugs are fixed, hopefully there are no other ones. The
new features will be worked into the next few releases.

Update
------
2001-08-28 - The log levels _now_ finally work correctly. I have
tested all the levels in the configuration file and the logging
function now outputs the correct information.

2001-08-27 - Fix one bug and two more crop up. The MIME type was
incorrect in the httperr() function; this has been fixed.
Jeffrey D. Wheelhouse included a patch to increase the stack size on
some machine (notably FreeBSD) and also included a patch to allow
tinyproxy to compile on FreeBSD. I really hope that _this_ is that
last minor-minor version for a while.

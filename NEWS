--------------------------

There has been a tonne of work done on tinyproxy since the beginning
of last week. I have been releasing minor-minor-minor point releases,
but the changes in this release constitute a minor-minor point
release. Please see the ChangeLog for detail descriptions of all the
changes, but here is a brief list.

The most serious fix is to the DNS caching system. There was a memory
leak in the system whenever a domain was already in the database, but
had expired. The new domain information was placed in the database,
but the old information wasn't freed.

The second change is in regard to the regular expression library. For
a while now tinyproxy has included it's own library (the GNU version)
in case the system did not have a working copy. Due to a bug in the
configure.in script the included REGEX library was being used even if
a working copy was detected. This was making tinyproxy larger than it
needed.

I would suggest that everyone upgrade to this version; especially
anyone who is still running 1.4.0 or below.

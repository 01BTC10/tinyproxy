Tinyproxy NEWS
==============

Version 1.7.2
-------------

 * Tinyproxy now reloads its configuration upon HUP signal.
 * Tinyproxy reopens its log file (instead of truncation) upon HUP
   signal. This is to play more nicely with logrotate.
 * File logging is now the default.
   Sylsog is chosen if and only if "SysLog Yes" is in the config.
   (I.e., a present "SysLog Yes" in the config file now overrides
    any LogFile setting.)
 * The XTinyProxy option is now a global boolean.
   Before,e it was documented to build a list of sites to add an
   x-tinyproxy header for, but it was implemented as global bool...
 * A new config option AddHeader allows to configure a list of
   custom headers.
 * A new config option DisableViaHeader allows to disable sending
   of the "Via:" header.
 * Tinyproxy is now IPv6-aware.
 * The config option PidFile now has a compiled in default.

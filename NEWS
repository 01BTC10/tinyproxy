    It's been a few months since I release the 1.4.3 version.  That's
a bit longer than I want to take with this release (which I originally
thought would be released a week after the 1.4.3 release in November
21, 2001 :), but my real life kind of intruded on the project.
Anyway, this release doesn't add any new features or functions; it's
basically a bug fix and standard compliance release.  A few
portability bugs have been fixed, and I've rewritten a few request
processing functions to make them more compliant with the HTTP
standard.

    Now, I've tested the request related code personally with all the
configurations I can think of, but I can't claim that it will work
perfectly with _every_ configuration and _every_ site.  So, please
give these pre-releases a thorough testing and let me know if there
any problems you've noticed.

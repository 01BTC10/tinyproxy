This is the long awaited 1.4.0 release of tinyproxy. Most of the
tinyproxy source has been rewritten in one form or another. The old
ADNS code has been removed, and the giant (ugly) state machine has
been banished. These have been replaced by a threaded connection
system. Not only did this make the source code cleaner, but it should
improve performance on SMP machines.

Another change to tinyproxy is the new configuration file. Take a look
at doc/tinyproxy.conf for an example of how to configure tinyproxy. If
you have any experience configuring the Apache web server you will
immediately see similarities between the tinyproxy and Apache
configuration files. In other words, we liberally copied from the
Apache style.

The access control list (ACL) feature of tinyproxy has been greatly
expanded. tinyproxy now allows you to selectively allow or deny a much
more specific set of IP addresses or subnets. In the same vein,
tinyproxy can be configured to only bind to one address on a
multi-homed machine.

If this version is not the best tinyproxy released, than it's pretty
darn close.

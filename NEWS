  This is another interim release of tinyproxy that fixes a few more bugs, 
and adds a feature or two (notably: non-blocking DNS lookups).  It was 
decided to move back what was previously going to be released as 1.3.2 and
release it as 1.4.0, as these bug fixes and patches were determined to be 
too high-priority to wait on.  

  In this version of 1.3.2, the are the following new features:
 
  - Non-blocking DNS lookups.
  
  And the following bug fixes:
 
  - A bug where connptr was not correctly being set before httperr was being
called in reqs.c.
  - A bug where the system would crash if an empty request was received.
  - A file descriptor leak where an fd would not be properly closed in 
event of a bad HTTP request. 

  Here is some information on the upcoming 1.4.0 release:

  1.4.0
  =====

  1.4.0 is in the works.  Some features you can expect:
 
  - Ability to listen on >1 port.
  - Ability to set up more than one access list for the allowed
    IP subnets.
  - Ability to listen on multiple interfaces specified on the command-line.
  - Simple caching.

  Under the hood, 1.4.0 should be a bit more modular than 1.3.2.  This
will hopefully lend itself towards making it easier for third parties to
develop new features for tinyproxy.  

  Please note that as of 1.3.1, Steven Young <sdyoung@well.com> is once
again the primary maintainer of tinyproxy.

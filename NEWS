 There are a few problems with this version of tinyproxy, but I'm hoping
 the benefits outweigh the negative. For some reason tinyproxy is not
 able to handle requests to *.x10.com sites. (As someone mentioned: "maybe
 this is a feature?" :) There also seem to be a few other random sites
 where tinyproxy is not communicating with the server correctly. If you
 find any such sites, let me know so I can add it to the list of domains
 where tinyproxy is failing. I'll need this information for the regression
 tests I plan on performing on the next release.

 As for the next release (1.5.0), I will not be adding new features.
 tinyproxy doesn't currently conform correctly to either the HTTP/1.0
 or the HTTP/1.1 standards. The goal of the 1.5 release therefore is
 to achieve standards compliance with at least HTTP/1.0. If you have
 looked at the tinyproxy code you will have noticed that all the real
 work of the proxy is performed in the reqs.c file. Therefore, other
 than bug fixes in the other files, only reqs.c should be changed in
 the 1.5.0 release. Basically, I'm hoping to just gut and replace the
 reqs.c file with a standards compliant version and release a new version.

 Depending on my schedule I should have the new version ready for
 pre-testing sometime next week. If you have any suggestions for improving
 tinyproxy please let me know, but I will not be incorporating them until
 1.6 (which _hopefully_ should come out fairly quickly after 1.5 has
 stabilised.)

 "Thank you" go out to all who have helped find bugs in the 1.4.3
 candidates. You know who you are, and if you don't look in the ChangeLog
 for your name. :)

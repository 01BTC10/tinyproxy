Tinyproxy NEWS
==============

Version 1.7.2
-------------

 * Tinyproxy now reloads its configuration upon SIGHUP signal.
 * Tinyproxy reopens its log file (instead of truncation) upon SIGHUP
   signal. This is to play more nicely with logrotate.
 * File logging is now the default.
   Syslog is chosen if and only if "SysLog Yes" is in the config,
   i.e., a present "SysLog Yes" in the config file now overrides
   any LogFile setting.
 * The XTinyProxy option is now documented as a global boolean.
   Before it was documented to build a list of sites to add a
   X-Tinyproxy header for, but it was implemented as global boolean.
 * A new config option AddHeader allows the user to configure a list of
   custom headers to send in outgoing HTTP requests.
 * A new config option DisableViaHeader allows the user to disable
   sending of the "Via:" header.
 * Tinyproxy is now IPv6 capable.
 * The config option PidFile now has a compiled in default.

Well so much for the 1.4.0 version being the best tinyproxy---there
were bugs. The most serious was that anonymous filtering was not
actually working. Another bug fix is that on Debian systems (and
maybe others) child threads would not be closed if they had been
created after tinyproxy had been started. Finally, if
MaxClientRequests was set to 0, the status of the thread was not going
back to T_WAITING.

Okay, now on to the new features. There is only one feature which is
the new Connect log level. This is basically "Info" without info's
noise.

There are a couple of features which I'm working on for the next
release. There has been requests for logging on tunnelled
connections. Also, some people would like HTTP filtering on tunnelled
connections.

So, the above bugs are fixed, hopefully there are no other ones. The
new features will be worked into the next few releases.

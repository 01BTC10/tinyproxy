Installing tinyproxy 1.3.2
==========================

  As of 1.3.2, tinyproxy uses Ian Jackson's adns library to perform non-blocking
DNS lookups.  As such, before you can do anything to install tinyproxy, you must
go into the adns-0.6/ subdirectory off the root tinyproxy distribution directory
and follow the INSTALL directions therein.  Once you have libadns installed, 
follow these steps:

  (1) Run the tinyproxy 'configure' script, found in the root distribution
      directory.  If you're unsure of exactly what arguments to use, please
      consult the output of 'configure --help'.  Additional documentation can
      be found for configure in the text file INSTALL.configure.
  (2) Run 'make install'.  This will build all of tinyproxy and install it
      in the default directory.  You may also wish to peruse src/config.h
      to be sure everything is configured to your liking.
  (3) Read the tinyproxy manpage - it will explain what commandline arguments
      and parameters are available.  More experienced users will probably 
      be able to get all the information they need from the output of 
      'tinyproxy -h'.

  Enjoy! Please read the documentation carefully, especially the COPYING
file which should have been included in this archive explaining the licensing
terms of tinyproxy.

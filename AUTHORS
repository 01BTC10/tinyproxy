  tinyproxy is a collaborative work between Steven Young
  <sdyoung@well.com> and Robert James Kaes <rjkaes@flarenet.com>.

  From versions 0-1.1, Steven Young was the primary maintainer.
  From 1.2 to 1.3.0, Robert James Kaes was the primary maintainer.
  As of 1.3.1, Steven Young will once again be the primary maintainer.

  Please see the ChangeLog for futher details as to who did what. :)

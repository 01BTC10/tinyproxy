  KNOWN BUGS
  ==========

  There is exactly one known bug at the time of 1.3.2's release - when
compiling under some Linux distributions (notably, Debian), the compile
process will generate a number of warnings regarding __underflow.  However,
tinyproxy still compiles and runs perfectly.  

  Patches welcome!

TINYPROXY(8)
============

NAME
----

tinyproxy - A light-weight HTTP proxy daemon


SYNOPSIS
--------

*tinyproxy* [-vldch]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*tinyproxy* is a light-weight HTTP proxy daemon designed to consume a
minimum amount of system resources. It listens on a given TCP port and
handles HTTP proxy requests. Designed from the ground up to be fast and
yet small, it is an ideal solution for use cases such as embedded
deployments where a full featured HTTP proxy is required, but the system
resources for a larger proxy are unavailable.


OPTIONS
-------

*tinyproxy* accepts the following options:

*-c <config-file>*::
    Use an alternate configuration file.

*-d*::
    Don't daemonize and stay in the foreground. Useful for debugging purposes.

*-h*::
    Display a short help screen of command line arguments and exit.

*-l*::
    Display the licensing agreement.

*-v*::
    Display version information and exit.


SIGNALS
-------

In addition to command-line options, there are also several signals that
can be sent to *tinyproxy* while it is running to generate debugging
information and to force certain events.

*SIGHUP*::
    Force Tinyproxy to do a garbage collection on the current
    connections linked list. This is usually done automatically after a
    certain number of connections have been handled.


FILES
-----

`/etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf`, `/var/run/tinyproxy.pid`, `/var/log/tinyproxy.log`

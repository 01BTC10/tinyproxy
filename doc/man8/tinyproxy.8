.SH "NAME"
tinyproxy \- A light-weight HTTP proxy daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBtinyproxy\fR [\-vldch]
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBtinyproxy\fR is a light\-weight HTTP proxy daemon designed to consume a minimum amount of system resources\&. It listens on a given TCP port and handles HTTP proxy requests\&. Designed from the ground up to be fast and yet small, it is an ideal solution for use cases such as embedded deployments where a full featured HTTP proxy is required, but the system resources for a larger proxy are unavailable\&.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBtinyproxy\fR accepts the following options:
.PP
\fB\-c <config\-file>\fR
.RS 4
Use an alternate configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Don\'t daemonize and stay in the foreground\&. Useful for debugging purposes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Display a short help screen of command line arguments and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR
.RS 4
Display the licensing agreement\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Display version information and exit\&.
.RE
.SH "SIGNALS"
In addition to command\-line options, there are also several signals that can be sent to \fBtinyproxy\fR while it is running to generate debugging information and to force certain events\&.
.PP
\fBSIGHUP\fR
.RS 4
Force Tinyproxy to do a garbage collection on the current connections linked list\&. This is usually done automatically after a certain number of connections have been handled\&.
.RE
.SH "TEMPLATE FILES"
There are two occasions when tinyproxy delivers HTML pages to the client on it\'s own right:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 1.\h'+02'When an error occurred, a corresponding error page is returned\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 2.\h'+02'When a request for the stathost is made, a page summarizing the connection statistics is returned\&. (See STATHOST below\&.)
.RE
The layout of both error pages and the statistics page can be controlled via configurable HTML template files that are plain HTML files that additionally understand a couple of template variables\&.
.sp
.SH "TEMPLATE VARIABLES"
There are several standard HTML variables that are available in every template file:
.PP
\fBrequest\fR
.RS 4
The full HTTP request line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcause\fR
.RS 4
The abbreviated cause of the error condition\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclientip\fR
.RS 4
The IP address of the client making the request\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclienthost\fR
.RS 4
The hostname of the client making the request\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBversion\fR
.RS 4
The version of tinyproxy\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpackage\fR
.RS 4
The package name\&. Presently, resolves to
\fItinyproxy\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdate\fR
.RS 4
The current date/time in HTTP format\&.
.RE
In addition, almost all templates support:
.PP
\fBdetail\fR
.RS 4
A detailed, plain English explanation of the error and possible causes\&.
.RE
When tinyproxy finds a variable name enclosed in braces, e\&.g\&. "{request}", then this is replaced by the value of the corresponding variable before delivery of the page\&.
.sp
.SH "STATHOST"
Tinyproxy returns an html page with connection statistics when it receives a HTTP request for a certain host \(em the stathost\&. The stathost name defaults to tinyproxy\&.stats and can be changed at compile\-time with the configure switch \-\-with\-stathost to any name or IP address\&.
.sp
The stat file template can be changed at runtime through the configuration variable StatFile\&.
.sp
.SH "FILES"
/etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy\&.conf, /var/run/tinyproxy\&.pid, /var/log/tinyproxy\&.log
.sp
.SH "BUGS"

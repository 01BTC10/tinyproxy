.SH BUGS
Due to the way the thread control is implimented, when a SIGTERM is sent
\fBtinyproxy\fR may not instantly terminate. It will finish sometime in the
following five seconds, but this could be problems when you need to stop and
start \fBtinyproxy\fR quickly. If anyone knows how to fix this, please let one
of the authors know.

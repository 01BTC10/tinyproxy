The following are some features that I'd like to add to tinyproxy in the
future.  Where possible, I've listed the person who suggested it.  This
list is in no particular order.  And hey, if you want to implement one of
these, or another idea you have, go right ahead.  Just mail me the diff
against the current tree and I'll integrate it if possible. 

  - Include hooks so other types of proxies can be modularly added to  
    the source tree.  Then people can simply choose which types of 
    proxies (ftp, www, etc) they'd like enabled in tinyproxy.h 
    Suggested: Tarun Tuli.
  - Make the source tree autoconf-ed so people can avoid editing
    tinyproxy.h and the like.
  - Add some kind of access control mechanism - probably IP-based, 
    so users can choose only to let people from certain networks/ISP
    use the proxy.  This becomes more of an issue with FTP proxies
    and the like. (Partially Done. It would be better if there was a
    config file.)
  - Find a more elegant solution to embedding HTML documents in the 
    source than the current method.  (see httperr() and showstats() for 
    examples of how it's done right now).
  - Include a function to rewrite the incoming requests. Should not be
    much of a problem. Just need to modify the clientreq code to look up
    the URL and rewrite it. If we want to go really fancy with RegEx
    mapping this could get ugly. :)
  - Ed Avis suggests having tinyproxy have the ability to send the data
    from the connections through an external filtering program. I kind of
    like this idea, but I don't really have a good way of doing it yet.

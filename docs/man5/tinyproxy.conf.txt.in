NAME
----

tinyproxy.conf - Tinyproxy HTTP proxy daemon configuration file


SYNOPSIS
--------

*tinyproxy.conf*


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`tinyproxy(8)` reads its configuration file, typically stored in
`/etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf` (or passed to Tinyproxy with -c on the
command line). This manpage describes the syntax and contents of the
configuration file.

The Tinyproxy configuration file contains key-value pairs, one per
line. Lines starting with `#` and empty lines are comments and are
ignored. Keywords are case-insensitive, whereas values are
case-sensitive. Values may be enclosed in double-quotes (") if they
contain spaces.

The possible keywords and their descriptions are as follows:

*User*::

    The user which the Tinyproxy process should run as, after the
    initial port-binding has been done as the `root` user. Either the
    user name or the UID may be specified.

*Group*::

    The group which the Tinyproxy process should run as, after the
    initial port-binding has been done as the `root` user. Either the
    group name or the GID may be specified.

*Port*::

    The port which the Tinyproxy service will listen on. If the port is
    less than 1024, you will need to start the Tinyproxy process as the
    `root` user.

*Listen*::

    By default, Tinyproxy listens for connections on all available
    interfaces (i.e. it listens on the wildcard address `0.0.0.0`).
    With this configuration parameter, Tinyproxy can be told to listen
    only on one specific address.

*Bind*::

    This allows you to specify which address Tinyproxy will bind
    to for outgoing connections to web servers or upstream proxies.

*BindSame*::

    If this boolean parameter is set to `yes`, then Tinyproxy will
    bind the outgoing connection to the IP address of the incoming
    connection that triggered the outgoing request.

*Timeout*::

    The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
    allowed to have before it is closed by Tinyproxy.

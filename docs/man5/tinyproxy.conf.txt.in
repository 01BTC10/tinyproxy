NAME
----

tinyproxy.conf - Tinyproxy HTTP proxy daemon configuration file


SYNOPSIS
--------

*tinyproxy.conf*


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`tinyproxy(8)` reads its configuration file, typically stored in
`/etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf` (or passed to Tinyproxy with -c on the
command line). This manpage describes the syntax and contents of the
configuration file.

The Tinyproxy configuration file contains key-value pairs, one per
line. Lines starting with `#` and empty lines are comments and are
ignored. Keywords are case-insensitive, whereas values are
case-sensitive. Values may be enclosed in double-quotes (") if they
contain spaces.

The possible keywords and their descriptions are as follows:

*User*::

    The user which the Tinyproxy process should run as, after the
    initial port-binding has been done as the root user.
    Note that you need to specify the user name here and may not
    use the UID number.

*Group*::

    The group which the Tinyproxy process should run as, after the
    initial port-binding has been done as the root user.
    Note that you need to specify the group name here and may
    not use the GID number.

*Port*::

    The port which the Tinyproxy service will listen on. If the port is
    less than 1024, you will need to start the Tinyproxy process as the
    root user.
